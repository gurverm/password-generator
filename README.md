## Description

This challenge required the understanding of various HTML and CSS properties including media queries and flexbox. The object was to create a protfolio that was responsive to UI commands on the navigation and images. The webpage is also responsive to change in various different screen sizes such that it adapts to the viewport of a given device. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

When inspecting the code it can be found that the webpage did not behave as intended in some cases. For example, the flexbox properties of the images could not be debugged; t was desired that the applications following the initial image be aligned into two columns and rows. 

The webpage does have have responsive commands through the UI in both the navigation bar as well as the images. Cicking on a link in the navigation will direct you to the corresponding area of the webpage. Clicking on an application image will send you to the deployed application.

Note: since I only have one deployed application the remaining images direct you to the source of the image. This will be changed and updated as Idevelop more applications.
